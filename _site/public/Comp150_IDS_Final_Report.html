        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>
        This paper introduces the similarities and differences of SVG and
        the HTML5 &#60;canvas&#62; element by studying their underlying
        data structures and code interaction. From these differences we expose subtle
        yet powerful insights into the continuity of the Rule of Least Power.
        These observations, tied with an understanding of the different use
        cases associated with each image format, illustrate the interoperability
        of SVG images with existing web technologies. Finally, we look at the
        ways the &#60;canvas&#62; element attempts to mirror the declarative
        form of SVGs despite its imperative nature and discuss its shortcomings.

        <h3 id="history">History of SVG and HTML5 Canvas</h3>
        <p>
        Scalable Web Graphics (SVG) is an image format for displaying
        two-dimensional graphics. It is an open source, XML-based, vector image
        format developed by the World Wide Web Consortium in 1999. SVG was
        first supported by the Konqueror web browser in 2003
        <sup><a href="#footnoteA">1</a></sup>, but since 2011 it
        has been supported by all major browsers.
        The HTML5 &#60;canvas&#62; element, first created by Apple in 2004
        <sup><a href="#footnoteB">2</a></sup> for use in Dashboard widgets
        and the Safari web browser, is a scriptable rendering space for
        bitmap images. Like SVG, &#60;canvas&#62; elements are currently
        supported by all major browsers.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h3 id="differences">Differences and Similarities</h3>
        <p>
        SVG and &#60;canvas&#62; are both used in many modern web applications
        for encapsulating images. Because SVGs are transformed into pixels on
        a screen when rendered, they are isomorphic to &#60;canvas&#62;
        elements. Any single image can be stored in either format. Moreover,
        both formats integrate into HTML and can be styled using CSS.
        <sup><a href="#footnoteE">3</a></sup>
        <sup><a href="#footnoteC">4</a></sup>
        </p>
        <p>
        However, the core difference between SVG and &#60;canvas&#62; is the underlying
        data structure storing the image. SVG incorporates a tree-like structure
        and can be accessed and mutated in a similar way to HTML. Each element
        within the SVG has its own DOM object and event handlers to apply
        changes to the image. Operations such as handling mouse-overs, mouse
        clicks, and repeated updates are built in to SVG objects. In addition,
        SVG incorporates some features and approaches that are part of the
        Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL) specification,
        which supports higher level programming functionality such as the
        <code>switch</code> element and the <code>systemLanguage</code>
        attribute.
        <sup><a href="#footnoteK">5</a></sup>
        </p>
        <p>
        A &#60;canvas&#62; element, however, implements a low-level bitmap whose
        pixels are directly exposed to the user through JavaScript. Unlike its
        SVG counterpart, a &#60;canvas&#62; element has no built-in event
        handlers and is completely stateless - users interested in manipulating
        a previously rendered &#60;canvas&#62; element must use JavaScript code
        and manipulate the object on a per-pixel basis.
        </p>
        <p>
        These differences in data structures are seen primarily in high
        fidelity images. Because SVGs are vector-based, any image can
        be scaled arbitrarily large or small without a loss of quality. A
        &#60;canvas&#62; element is instead rastered at a fixed precision
        set by both the height and width of the object in conjunction to
        the resolution of the image. Furthermore, at large screen sizes SVG
        images have a significant performance boost because the rendering
        client only interacts with a portion of the total pixels. Because a
        &#60;canvas&#62; element is simply a pixel bitmap, the rendering
        agent can take no shortcuts in rendering as it must iterate over the
        entire bitmap. This is shown in the left side of the following chart
        <sup><a href="#footnoteD">6</a></sup>
         displaying the rendering time as a function of the size of
        a screen.
        </p>
        <img src="https://i-msdn.sec.s-msft.com/dynimg/IC496481.png" alt="SVG vs Canvas performance chart"/>
        <p>
        So if SVG images can scale without degrading in quality, have built-in
        support for updates via event handlers, and can integrate into existing
        web technologies through the DOM, why on Earth are &#60;canvas&#62;
        elements useful at all?
        </p>
        <p>
        The right side of the above chart begins to illustrate the drawbacks
        associated with the seemingly omnipotent SVG. All of the overhead
        created through the tree-like data structure illustrated above as
        well as the built-in code used for user interaction adds up when
        SVG elements are used frequently within a page. Because of the
        relatively simple model of a pixel bitmap used as the underlying data
        structure within a &#60;canvas&#62; element, page load speeds do not
        suffer under heavy use.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h3 id="ruleofleastpower">Rule of Least Power</h3>
        <p>
        As demonstrated above, there are significant differences in the benefits
        and costs associated with the SVG and &#60;canvas&#62; image formats
        due to overhead correlated with their data structure and functionality.
        Each format's strengths can be maximized depending on the use case
        of their application. For example, while weather maps do not require
        a large surface area, the number of objects on the screen is
        considerably high. With &#60;canvas&#62; elements, these can be redrawn
        quickly without accessing the DOM to provide real-time radar reports.
        <sup><a href="#footnoteF">7</a></sup>
        Contrasting this are high-fidelity logos and designs intended for high
        resolution monitors and iPads. These require vector graphics to support
        responsive scaling at all sizes through SVG.
        <sup><a href="#footnoteG">8</a></sup>
        </p>
        <p>
        Based on these use cases, it may be intuitive to think of the use cases
        along a spectrum of complexity; for the simpler case in which images
        are static, used frequently, or never need to change resolution,
        the &#60;canvas&#62; element is much better suited. This juxtaposes
        strongly to seemingly more complex cases in which images need to scale
        to different resolutions or be constantly updated with event handlers
        through the DOM. In this case, SVG is clearly the better solution. It
        appears the Rule of Least Power applies quite well, since the more
        complex problems require considerable overhead through the tree-like
        structure and code functionality of the SVG graphics whereas more
        straightforward problems can be implemented using a two-dimensional
        bitmap.
        </p>
        <p>
        However, this spectrum relies on the use case of images being rendered
        to the screen. While the act of rendering is the main goal of these
        image formats, the Rule of Least Power suggests a more
        subtle discrepancy due to the difference of SVG's declarative versus the
        &#60;canvas&#62; element's imperative approach to image rendering.
        </p>
        <p>
        This can be seen in software that consumes image files without
        ultimately rendering them to the screen. Parsing the two-dimensional
        bitmap of pixels under the hood of a &#60;canvas&#62; element requires
        considerable energy to identify the contents of the image and in some
        cases may even be impossible. However, the declarative form of the
        XML used in SVGs allows for easy consumption of the content of the
        image directly. In addition, the XML is a text format and can be
        not only parsed but also edited by many software components. A striking
        example of this is the Google crawler indexing SVG files, whether
        standalone or embedded directly into HTML.
        <sup><a href="#footnoteH">9</a></sup>
        </p>
        <p>
        This demonstrates the non-continuity of the Rule of Least Power. By
        juxtaposing use cases intended for human consumption (i.e. the
        resulting images) with those aimed for software digestion, we see
        the Rule of Least Power does not create a rigid spectrum in terms
        of problem complexity. SVG can be used to create complex images
        capable of updating frequently and rescaling to different resolutions
        while also making itself available for content scraping by software.
        Canvas elements instead have a "sweet spot" in which their low overhead
        can be utilized to provide performant solutions to a separate subset
        of problems at a cost of making them unsuitable for content
        identification.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h3 id="fallbackcontent">Limitations of Fallback Content</h3>
        <p>
        The &#60;canvas&#62; element attempts to rectify this situation and
        appears to be consumable at the
        low level of software through "fallback content". From the Mozilla
        Firefox documentation, fallback content can be placed "inside the
        &#60;canvas&#62; element. Browsers that don't support &#60;canvas&#62;
        will ignore the container and render the fallback content inside it.
        Browsers that do support &#60;canvas&#62; will ignore the content inside
        the container, and just render the canvas normally."
        <sup><a href="#footnoteI">10</a></sup>
        </p>
        <p>
        By attempting to help users viewing the &#60;canvas&#62; elements
        through a browser, the fallback content actively detracts from other
        software's ability to consume &#60;canvas&#62; elements directly. This
        relates once again to the difference in use cases between web browsers displaying images
        and software solely designed to extract information from web content. Fallback
        content is not designed to be an exact replica of the information
        contained within the &#60;canvas&#62; element; instead, real-world use
        cases in the Mozilla documentation suggest replacing dynamic &#60;canvas&#62;
        content with a static image as fallback content. While this attempts
        to give users helpful feedback when browsing the webpage, it is
        disastrous when attempting to extract useful information about the
        content of the &#60;canvas&#62; element without rendering it. Should
        a crawler ignore the &#60;canvas&#62; completely if it cannot be
        parsed directly or use the fallback content which may not even directly
        correspond to the actual content at all? This contrasts sharply with the
        declarative format of SVGs which avoid this ambiguity.
        </p>
        <p>
        In addition, the fallback content of a &#60;canvas&#62; is entirely
        optional. This further complicates the already haphazard relationship
        between consumers of web content and &#60;canvas&#62; elements. This
        is built upon in the next section within the Mozilla documentation which
        notes &#60;canvas&#62; elements require a closing &#60;/canvas&#62; tag.
        Without this, "the rest of the document would be considered the fallback
        content and wouldn't be displayed".
        <sup><a href="#footnoteL">11</a></sup>
        This inherent brittleness of the &#60;canvas&#62; element further
        complicates interaction with software that examines web content. A
        misplaced &#60;/canvas&#62; tag can cause a crawler to mistake the
        entire web page's content for the fallback content of the image. This
        contrasts sharply with the spirit of Postel's Law in that it is
        impossible to determine where a closing &#60;/canvas&#62; tag should
        go since fallback content can be optional or some portion of the
        remaining HTML content. The
        &#60;canvas&#62; element is completely ill-equipped to be consumed by
        software examining web content.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
        Ultimately, SVG and &#60;canvas&#62; elements illustrate a subtle point
        in the non-continuity of the Rule of Least Power. Based on their data
        structure choices and relative overhead, each can be used for powerful
        applications of images; however, the underlying differences in the SVG's
        declarative versus the &#60;canvas&#62; element's imperative style lead
        for vastly different levels of interoperability with other web software.
        </p>
        <p>
        Because of the low cost associated with the two-dimensional bitmap of the
        &#60;canvas&#62; element, it is widely used for performance reasons.
        In addition, through WebGL it can be used to support high performance
        three-dimensional applications such as games and data visualizations.
        <sup><a href="#footnoteJ">12</a></sup>
        </p>
        <p>
        However, as the interoperability between software components on the web
        has been increasingly stressed, I believe SVG will continue to be
        the leading image format used for commercial uses. As shown above, its
        declarative form lends itself to not only consumption across multiple
        levels of software such as the Google crawler for SEO but also across
        various devices in different resolutions. Since mobile devices are here
        to stay, I believe SVG's only significant drawback being related to
        performance cost will evaporate as hardware continues to advance.
