  <strong>About Me</strong>
  <br />
</h1>

I am a software engineer with experience
in the design, implementation, and operational excellence of
back-end software products at global scale. I have
a passion for precise, design-oriented software development
(primarily in TypeScript and Python)
mixed with customer-focused metrics and deployment. I live in Lincoln, MA.

In addition, I have been an avid potter
at <a href='https://mudflat.org'>Mudflat Pottery School</a>
since 2018. You can view some of my most recent
pieces <a href='/pottery'>here</a>.
