  <strong>About Me</strong>
  {% include elements/button.html link="/assets/resume-2022.pdf" text="Resume" %}
</h1>

I am a Boston-based software engineer with experience
in the design, implementation, and operational excellence of
back-end software products at global scale. I have
a passion for precise, design-oriented software development
(primarily in <a href='https://nodejs.org/en/'>Node.js</a>)
mixed with customer-focused metrics and deployment
(usually via <a href='https://kubernetes.io/'>Kubernetes</a>).

In addition, I have been an avid potter
at <a href='https://mudflat.org'>Mudflat Pottery School</a>
since 2018. You can view some of my most recent
pieces <a href='/pottery'>here</a>.
